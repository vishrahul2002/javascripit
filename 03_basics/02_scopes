// Global Scope : is the value declare globally it is not inside the function, for loops or if and else

// Block Scope : is the value declare inside the function, if else or inside the { }


// eg:

// var is global scope
// let and const are block scope in js
let a = "hello"
var c = "heyy"
{
    let a = 100;
    const b = 200;
    c = 300;
}

console.log(a); // here it log "hello" because it is outside the block scope
// console.log(b); //here it will throw an ReferenceError b is not defined
console.log(c); // c will log 300 insted of "heyy"as it is an global scope and can be override the previous value
